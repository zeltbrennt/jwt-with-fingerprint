# Demo Project JWT /w Fingerprint

This demo project illustrates how to save a JWT access Token in the session storage of the client while also using a 
hardened cookie as a fingerprint to secure the token against XSS.   

I replicated the same flow in Java Spring [here](https://github.com/zeltbrennt/jwt-with-fingerprint-java)
